### Licenses

[Google material design icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) are ones used in this repository, licenced under their own [licence](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/LICENSE).

Updates made to original icons:
- A part of the icons are used not all of them.
- Inner svg elements (children) are extracted from every icon, and put within the @amaui/ui-react Icon component as children.
- Every icon from there is made into it's own React component as part of this UI library.
